         <h4>
          #veryjazzed is a boutique music rights management group. Gradient
          since 2013. Our roster is special, our artists are special, we are
          special. We understand who we are serving and to what end. We are
          fixed on quality, people, and growth. We have our own language. We
          take small steps early and often. Our network is interdependent. We
          share knowledge and resources freely and without conditionals. We
          leverage the finite against our unending ability to create new and
          inspired works. We pride ourselves in recognizing strengths and
          bridging blindspots. We are inspired makers.
        </h4>
          <section id="mountain-container"></section>
          <h4>
          We have three sides. We are public facing: promoting works, tours, and
          success stories. We are artist facing: managing the needs, visions,
          and admin for our artists. We are industry facing: building an
          infrastructure and partnering with some of the most earnest and
          integral companies in the space. We are always connecting with new
          people in each of these domains. Our model is to find people of agency
          and build difficult things with them.
        </h4>
          <section id="path-container"></section>
        <h4>
          We believe producing great works is simple but detailed. The alignment
          of the creator, their story, the work, and the vehicle they choose to
          communicate it. If we can get organized with these elements, we feel
          we have found success: earnest recordings, clarity of persona,
          step-by-step narrative, stimulating visuals, malleable marketing,
          leverageable live performances, honest sm, high-value merch, and
          archiving the work of our lives in an organized manner. When a project
          gets on radar, we do our best to see it for what it is, what it could
          be, and help facilitate the delta between the two. We are super
          flexible, always reverting to first principles when deciding what is
          our next and best step is.

          If you are a listener, a maker, or a builder and you resonate with
          what we are working to achieve, we should know about each other. We
          would love to hear what you are excited about and how we might be a
          valuable resource. Reach out to us.
